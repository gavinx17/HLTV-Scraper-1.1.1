# HLTV Scraper

HLTV Scraper is used for retrieving data from HLTV.org. I chose to use selenium instead of requests to get a better understanding of how it works.
You can retrieve top players' and teams' stats effortlessly as well as look up your favorite player and see how they compare to the average statistics.
LIVE match data from your favorite teams is available in real-time, coming soon, all of the data available on HLTV will be compared against the other teams' players and data.
